# Android Messaging app using Firebase
This is my messaging application I made for android. It implements google firebase to handle user authentication, using Google sign in as messaging profile. I have plans in the future to add Facebook login and email and password as authentication methods. 
Messages are saved on persisting firebase database, messages will be updated on each clientâ€™s view as messages are sent. A recyclerview was used as opposed to a listview to display messages to improve overall performance.
Future features for this app include:
*	Friends list/Address book feature
*	Group chat functionality
*	Display profile picture beside messages
*	Allow user to update and change profile picture
